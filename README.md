## Introduction
This is a code repository for the corresponding video tutorial. 

Corona Virus is, unfortunately, spreading through the world. What can we, as developers, do to make the situation better? We can help to spread awareness by visualizing the data. The data is fetched from the API and we'll create cards displaying the statistics as well as Charts.

API used: https://covid19.mathdro.id/api

Setup:
- run ```npm i && npm start```
